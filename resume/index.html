In the first months of 2014 started the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) CASIS project where we identified staff members, along with a new warehouse location that provided imaging and laser etching services for SDP’s new equipment orders of Apple devices.  In addition to revenue generating projects, provided project management for Stony River’s sister companies and parent company intra-corporate IT Support services of a mixed environment of Windows, Mac, Linux by designing and implementing a new virtual infrastructure (VMWare ESXi and Microsoft HyperV).  This project required collecting requirements from each sister company (spread through the US), communication announcing production cut-over milestones, and budgeting for long term success.

<p><strong>TKC Technology Solutions, LLC / Qivliq Commercial Group, LLC</strong> - <em>Sr. Project Manager / Field Engineer (Oct 2005 - Oct 2012)</em> - My time at TKC Technology Solutions began with being the Project Manager for a multi-million dollar DOD OCONUS sub-sea cabling project.

All positions required documentation skills at the highest level as I was either sharing knowledge, or defining assumptions along with requirements for proprietary internal software.  Internal projects followed a familiar methodology of identifying stakeholders, project kickoffs meetings, scope definition, and task management.  As new tasks were introduced to the project, evaluations were needed to ensure that the task would not interfere with existing work-flows along with technical restrictions.  Primary external project was assisting with deploying Wi-Fi services throughout the Manhattan Burroughs in New York City, NY.  Lessons learned in managing physical designed, inter-networking, and back-end offices were extremely beneficial to my career in large scale projects.</p>
